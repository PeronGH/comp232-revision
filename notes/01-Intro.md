## Course Aims
1. Provide understanding of main security, confidentiality, and privacy problems in computers and networks
2. Enable understanding of main approaches for problem solving/mitigation and their strengths and weaknesses
3. Develop knowledge and skills in practical applications of available security solutions
4. Introduce theoretical foundations of cybersecurity and attract attention to open problems requiring further research

## Cybersecurity Overview
- Cyberspace: electronic medium used to form global computer network(s) to facilitate online communication
- Security: condition resulting from protective measures ensuring inviolability from hostile acts or influences
- Privacy: ability to control availability of information about oneself and to function anonymously in society
- Security and privacy are interlinked concepts

## Interesting Aspects of Cybersecurity
- Involves various scientific fields (Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, Biology)
- Technological aspects (global networking, cloud computing)
- Economical issues (costly cybersecurity)
- Legal & political issues (fighting back, political influence)
- Social and moral aspects (trading privacy for better security)

## Costly Cybersecurity
- Average cost of a malware attack on a company: $2.6 million
- Average cost of a data breach: $3.9 million
- Highest cost from cybercrime in financial services industry: $18.3 million per company surveyed
- Healthcare industry has the highest number of ransomware attacks (quadrupled in 2020)

## Cybersecurity Jobs
- 82% of employers report a shortage of cybersecurity skills
- 3.5 million unfilled cybersecurity jobs globally in 2021
- Demand for Data Protection Officers (DPOs) has risen over 700% since 2016 due to GDPR demands

## Hacker Threats
- Stolen data can be sold to other hackers on the dark web
- Identity theft using victim's credit card or taking loans in their name
- Phishing attacks and extortion using stolen personal information

## Industrial Software Security
- Stuxnet: computer worm discovered in June 2010, targeting Siemens industrial software and equipment
- 60% of infected computers were in Iran (August 2010), including controllers handling centrifuges at Natanz nuclear facilities
- Possibly a field test of a cyber weapon
